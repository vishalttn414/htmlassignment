Question6-What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

Answer6-IDs and classes are HTML attributes used to identify and style elements, but they have 
important differences in their usage and rules:

ID:
<div id="header">Header content</div>
<div id="main-content">Main content</div>

Must be unique in a page (can't reuse the same ID)
Selected in CSS with # symbol: #header { }
More specific in CSS specificity hierarchy
JavaScript can find element by getElementById()

Classes:

<div class="card">First card</div>
<div class="card">Second card</div>
<div class="card important">Special card</div>

Can be reused on multiple elements
Selected in CSS with . symbol: .card { }
Less specific than IDs in CSS specificity
Multiple classes can be added to one element
JavaScript can find elements by getElementsByClassName().
