Question1-What is HTML, and how is an HTML document structured?

Answer1- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
It uses tags to define different elements and structure content on a webpage.
A basic HTML document has this essential structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>

1. <!DOCTYPE html> - Declares that this is an HTML5 document
2. <html> - The root element that contains all other elements
3. <head> - Contains metadata about the document, including:

4. <title> - Sets the page title shown in browser tabs
5. <meta> - Defines metadata like character encoding


6.<body> - Contains the visible page content, including:

Text
Images
Links
Forms
And other elements

HTML elements are typically structured hierarchically, with parent elements containing child 
elements. Most elements have both opening and closing tags (like <p> and </p>), though some 
self-closing tags exist (like <img />).
